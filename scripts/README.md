This folder contains analysis scripts used by the Snakemake RNA-seq pipeline.

## deseq2_analysis.R

Performs differential gene expression analysis using **DESeq2**.

### Input
- Gene count matrix generated by `featureCounts`
- Sample metadata file (conditions, replicates)

### Output
- Differential expression results table (log2FC, p-value, adjusted p-value)
- Optional summary plots (MA plot, volcano plot)

### How it is used
This script is **called from the Snakefile** and is not intended to be run manually.

All inputs and outputs are handled by Snakemake to ensure reproducibility.

### Dependencies
- DESeq2
- tidyverse
- pheatmap (if used)

Dependencies are installed via the Conda environment defined in `envs/deseq2.yaml`.
