# RNA-seq Analysis Snakemake Pipeline

An end-to-end RNA-seq differential expression analysis pipeline implemented using Snakemake, covering quality control, read alignment, quantification, statistical analysis, and functional enrichment. This workflow is designed for reproducible, modular, and scalable RNA-seq analyses. Pipeline tested locally with public Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA-seq data.

Status: Tested and functional | Input data must be provided by the user.

# Overview

This pipeline automates the entire RNA-seq workflow, starting from raw FASTQ files to downstream analysis and visualization of differential gene expression.

 Workflow:

Raw FASTQ

Quality Control (FastQC)
   │
   ▼
Read Alignment (STAR)
   │
   ▼
Gene Quantification (featureCounts)
   │
   ▼
Differential Expression Analysis (DESeq2)
   │
   ▼
Visualization
 ├─ Volcano Plot
 ├─ MA Plot
 ├─ PCA Plot
 └─ Heatmaps
   │
   ▼
Functional Enrichment (GO BP, MF, CC)
   │
   ▼
Results Export (CSV/PNG)


It is suitable for single or multiple conditions, and is built for reproducibility using Snakemake’s workflow management.

# Outputs

results/fastqc/ – FastQC HTML and zip reports

counts/ – Gene-level count tables from featureCounts

results/deseq2/ – Differential expression tables, plots, and summaries

logs/ – Snakemake execution logs

DESeq2 R script workflow:

Reads raw count matrix and sample metadata

Filters low-count genes and replaces NAs

Performs DE analysis and calculates log2 fold changes

Produces significant upregulated, downregulated, and combined DEGs

Generates volcano, MA, PCA plots, and heatmaps

Performs GO enrichment analysis (BP, MF, CC) using clusterProfiler

Saves all results in results/ directory
